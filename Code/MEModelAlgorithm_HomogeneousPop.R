library(MTM)

## The code below is used to fit multi-environment (ME) model for same individuals across different environments.
## The ME model is fitted by using R package MTM MTM (de los Campos and Gr√ºneberg, 2016) with 20,000 iterations and the first 10,000 samples as burn-in. 
## y is phenotype data of multiple environments
## WK is the genetic relationship of individuals estimated by weighted kernel
## B is the background genetic relationship of individuals that is not explained by genetic markers
